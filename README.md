 ## Motivation
This repository is an attempt to recreate the results obtained in the paper referenced above. A PID controller was designed in Python to validate the simulation results presented in section V of the paper. The paper can also be found in the repository. 


## Simulation 1
The plots of Regulation Error for L1=1,3,5 are shown below.
